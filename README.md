The Cardiac Monitoring System is an IoT-based healthcare solution that continuously tracks a patient’s heart rate using sensors. It detects abnormalities like tachycardia or bradycardia, verifies them to avoid false alerts, and sends instant email alerts to doctors via a secure web portal for timely medical intervention.
